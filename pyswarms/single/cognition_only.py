r"""
A cognition-only Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

An implementation of PSO where c2 is fixed to 0, resulting in no information being exchanged between particles. Each
particle can be seen as an individual hill-climber with a velocity as well. This implementation inherits from the local
best PSO implementation so that each particle sees it's personal best position as the global best but topology does not
matter as the social component of the velocity equation is eliminated.

        ----------
        n_particles : int
            number of particles in the swarm.
        dimensions : int
            number of dimensions in the space.
        bounds : tuple of np.ndarray, optional (default is :code:`None`)
            a tuple of size 2 where the first entry is the minimum bound
            while the second entry is the maximum bound. Each array must
            be of shape :code:`(dimensions,)`.
        velocity_clamp : tuple (default is :code:`(0,1)`)
            a tuple of size 2 where the first entry is the minimum velocity
            and the second entry is the maximum velocity. It
            sets the limits for velocity clamping.
        center : list (default is :code:`None`)
            an array of size :code:`dimensions`
        ftol : float
            relative error in objective_func(best_pos) acceptable for
            convergence

                    inertia parameter
                * k : int
                    number of neighbors to be considered. Must be a
                    positive integer less than :code:`n_particles`
                * p: int {1,2}
                    the Minkowski p-norm to use. 1 is the
                    sum-of-absolute values (or L1 distance) while 2 is
                    the Euclidean (or L2) distance.
        init_pos : :code:`numpy.ndarray` (default is :code:`None`)
            option to explicitly set the particles' initial positions. Set to
            :code:`None` if you wish to generate the particles randomly.
